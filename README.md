## üß© Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This course emphasizes the four core principles of OOP in Java:

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within classes, restricting direct access to some of an object's components.
- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes from existing ones, promoting code reuse and establishing hierarchical relationships.
- **Polymorphism:** The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through interfaces or inheritance, allowing methods to behave differently based on the object.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
  These concepts are practiced throughout the course with examples and assignments.
